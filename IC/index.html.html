</b> </h3>
<p style="color:solid black;text-align:left;font-family:Brush Script MT;font-size:22;">Dear Student, 
Due to Covid-19 pandemic ,<br>
 academic activity in our college has come to a grinding halt.<br>
 It seems that there is no possibility of regular class work <br>
in near future and we can not afford to continue like this.<br>
 Inorder to ensure that we adhere to advisories of staying <br>indoors the online mode of teaching is to be adopted.<br>
 To ensure a smooth academic delivery and engage you in a <br>
virtual learning process college has been working overtime and in an overdrive.<br>
 Your teachers have been busy in preparing notes/content as per your syllabus. 
In these days College has taken strong steps for further <br>
development of in-house ERP and has launched a Learning Management <br>
System (LMS) the Islamia College Content Management System short named as IC-CMS. <br>
Through the IC-CMS platform all bonafide students of college will be able to login into a <br>
particular classroom wherein they will be able to download the
<br> syllabus specific content ,which has been compiled in-house by respective faculty members painstakingly since last fortnight. <br>
Further a student can upload an assignment and participate in a quiz on said platform. <br> <br>
